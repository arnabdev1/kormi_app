## Overview

Kormi is a web application built on the MERN stack that aims to connect domestic workers with verified clients. It will ensure competitive pay for workers and a trusted worker for the client. The platform allows domestic workers to apply for their profiles to be posted and undergo strict verification of their true identity. Once verified, domestic workers can be hired by trusted clients through the website.
